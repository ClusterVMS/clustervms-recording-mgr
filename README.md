# ClusterVMS Recording Manager

Recording manager for ClusterVMS. Provides the public API for managing and retrieving recordings.

Currently this just wraps around a single Moonfire instance and provides an alternative API for it, but eventually it will support MULTIPLE independent recording backends (Moonfire or otherwise), spread across nodes.
